### The topic of house rent is one of our society's most fundamental issues. When people search for affordable accommodations in city areas physically, it is incredibly difficult to find it nowadays. The house owner, on the other hand, must also rent the property. House owners can sign up for the app and use it to post all of the details about the house they want to rent, such as its location (region, city, sub-city), price, number of rooms, and photographs. Someone looking for a home can go to the smartphone app, look at the residences, and contact the house owner.
